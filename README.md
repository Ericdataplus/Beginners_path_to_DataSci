# Beginners_path_to_DataSci
This is my suggested path to learning A.I and Data Science with no prerequisites required. 

# Step 1

[Typing club](https://www.typingclub.com/) You don't need to touch type to code but it does make learning easier when you don't have to look down all the time to find symbols and to be less discouraged when invetible erros pop up, touch typing will definitely help you iterate through them much more quickly. 

# Step 2

[DataQuest](https://app.dataquest.io/dashboard) After you're comfortable with your typing abilities you can get started with python with no prerequisites. DataQuest is free up until midway through pandas (which is pretty great!). I suggest doing the free portion of Dataquest up until step 2 of pandas that's available for free and lastly the available data visualization mission line charts. 

# Step 3

[Kaggle Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) After the free portion of Dataquest ending with line charts you can move onto kaggle's courses. I would skip the Python basics portion on Kaggle because you covered that in the free portion of Dataquest (though you can if you want to I just don't suggest it). 

Instead start with intro to machine learning which I assume is your reason and motivation to learn programming. All you need is the basics of python which you learned for free on Dataquest and some pandas which you learned for free on Dataquest.

After intro to machine learning move onto to machine learning intermediate and after that you will know how to apply a machine learning algorithm called XGBoost (tree based algorithm) on datasets and know the machine learning conventions to move on. 

# Step 4 

You can either go back to [DataQuest](https://app.dataquest.io/dashboard) if you decide to pay for it to move on from the pandas portion that was locked in the free portion or you can continue on with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) to the courses after the intermediate machine learning course.
